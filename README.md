## Introduction

Football is the most popular sport globally, with millions of fans and players. This project utilizes FIFA data to answer key questions about player performance and attributes, providing insights for football enthusiasts, analysts, and researchers.

---

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to explore FIFA player data and predict player ratings using various machine learning models. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applying predictive techniques, we aim to:

- Understand the distribution of player attributes.
- Identify patterns and trends.
- Predict a playerâ€™s rating in the latest edition of the FIFA game.
